            <p id="side-box-p" class="side-box-p">The first website I built was for a business. I was new to web development but I had a decent grasp on HTML and CSS basics. The owner waned a simple layout but wanted a contact form for potential new clients to be able to contact her from the website. This is something that I had never done before. I then got to exploring google on how to properly make a contact form with functionality. After about a day and a half of endless google searches and trying every possible outcome I settled on a PHP form. The difficult part was setting up the form to get the users message and info and then relay that info to the owners work email that was linked through the hosting server. I finally got it working correctly after sending countless amounts of test emails.</p>

            <p id="side-box-p2" class="side-box-p">One of the first projects I did completely on my own with implementing mainly Javascript was a click game that recorded how many clicks you do in 5 seconds. The seconds counter countdown in live time and resets every time you hit the reset button. Depending on how many clicks you get the page will display text what your skill level is. After the timer is up the page will also display how many clicks you got in that 5 seconds. Another awesome feature that I had never done before was implementing a dark mode and light mode button. With a click of a button the page colors will display a dark theme that is easier on the eyes.
